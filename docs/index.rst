Welcome to SSBtoolkit's documentation!
======================================

The SSB computational toolkit was developed to easily predict classical pharmacodynamic models of drug-GPCR (class A) 
interactions given just as input structural information of the receptor and the ligand. The toolkit doesn't use any novel 
or untested methods. Instead, it brings together free and/or open source bioinformatic tools into a user-friendly pipeline to
be used by experts and non-experts. The pipeline was built, as a first instance, in a jupyter notebook - an 
interactive computational environment for replication and exploration of scientific code and analysis. 
Nowadays, jupyter notebooks are being extensively used by the computational biology community, making 
them the preferred choice to share and rerun computational 
protocols.
