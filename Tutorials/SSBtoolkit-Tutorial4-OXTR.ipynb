    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) regulates multiple social and emotional behaviors, such as bonding, reciprocal trust, aggression, fear, and anxiety, in both animals and humans. It has been suggested as a biomarker and target for the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  [(Mayer et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01241-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "OXT exerts its function by binding to its target receptor (OXTR), a member of the Class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) family.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutation of an alanine residue at position 218 to a threonine (A218T) in the OXTR has been associated with a phenotype related to ASD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vitro experiments have shown differences in the dynamics of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> between the wild-type OXTR (OXTR-WT) and the OXTR-A218T variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand these differences, we will use the SSB Toolkit to fit a mathematical model of the OXTR signaling pathway to the observed experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we aim to simulate and study the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is triggered by the G<sub>q</sub> pathway (to which OXTR couples), we will use a combination of two previously existing models: one for the activation of the G<sub>q</sub> protein and another for the dynamic model of IP<sub>3</sub>R action. See [Mayer et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01241-8) for all the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Data\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>n vitro evaluation of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses using Fura-2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (see figures a and b) revealed reduced basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in A218T cells compared to WT, both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (figure <b>c</b>). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the amplitude of the OXT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was higher in A218T cells compared to WT cells incubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Ringer (figure <b>d</b>). \n",
    "        \n",
    "The area under the curve (AUC) showed a cell line-specific effect, indicating a higher increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration upon OXT stimulation in A218T cells compared to WT cells (figure <b>e</b>). \n",
    "    \n",
    "The full width at half maximum (FWHM), reflecting the kinetics of the OXT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, also differed significantly between the two cell lines, irrespective of the bathing solution. This indicates a prolonged OXT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in A218T cells (figure <b>f</b>).\n",

    "## Modeling of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration differences between WT and A218T OXTR\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mail goal is to use the <b>SSB toolkit</b> to rationalize the experimentally measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations with 100 nM OXT in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<b>figure e, blue bars</b>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular modeling results have suggested that the A218T variant affects receptor activation (see [Mayer et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01241-8) for details). This implies that the variant may influence the kinetic parameters governing the receptor activation reaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we will simulate the OXTR signalling model by varying the forward kinetic constant of the reaction that describes Gq-protein binding to the receptor, which implicitly depends on receptor activation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will use the SSB Toolkitâ€™s built-in function `Simulation.FitModel()`. This function allows us to iteratively simulate the model until we obtain the desired ratio of the concentration of a signaling species between a model simulated with modified parameters and a model simulated with reference parameters."
