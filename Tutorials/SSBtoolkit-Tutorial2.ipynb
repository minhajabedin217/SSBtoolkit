A simulation of a methamatical model of a signaling pathway consists of the integration of a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as function of time. Since each ODE represents a molecular event of the signaling pathway, when integrated over time, such equations can describe how the concentration of species inside the model changes over time. The key point of this tutorial is the use of the drug-receptor affinity value (K<sub>d</sub>) to fire up the model. With the K<sub>d</sub> values one can calculate the fraction of receptors that are occupied by the ligand in the equilibrium and, according to the *occupancy theory*, the fraction of occupied receptors represents the concentration of activated receptors in the equilibrium *([Kenakin T., 2004 ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2004.02.012))*. üìñ Read the [Docs](https://ssbtoolkit.readthedocs.io/) for more details.\n",
